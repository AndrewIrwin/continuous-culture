# continuous-culture

This repository contains R/Shiny application to describe phytoplankton growth equations. The equations are derived from [Grover (1991)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285254).

The equations can be used in contiuous culture mode as either a chemostat or turbidostat or in "discrete" versions (batch and semi-continuous batch).

This is my first attempt at a R/Shiny interactive document.
